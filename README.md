# Overview
This was an attempt to create a node.js multiplayer game. It is a clone of Code Names. It was developed during COVID-19 quarantine as a way to socialize (via voice chat) and connect with friends. It is a great game, relatively inexpensive, and if you like it in my simple clone, I'd highly recommend it.

# Implementation
This was built using node.js and socket.io. I started with an existing open source tic-tac-toe game, but almost all that code has been changed or removed. It was my introduction to both and done relatively quickly, so the quality of the code itself is questionable.
